## What is this

This post is a part of the video curation series where I list interesting videos
from multiple sources with a short summary of the video for you to decide if
it's worth watching or listening.

## How to consume these videos

These videos will be geared towards background listening, shoutout to the people
who need white noise while they work and have transcended from just music. For a
twist, these videos can also be consumed during a meal or even to learn
something new if you are craving some information.
